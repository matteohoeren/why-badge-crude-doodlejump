# Doodle Jump Game Implementation Task List

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Basic Setup and Map Rendering
- [x] Create TASKLIST.md 
- [x] Set up SDL3 window and renderer (640x480 to match SDL examples)
- [x] Fixed keyboard input type issue (const bool * instead of const Uint8 *)
- [x] Implement basic game structure with SDL callbacks
- [x] Create platform data structure
- [x] Implement map generation with platforms
- [x] Render platforms as rectangles
- [x] Implement camera/viewport system that follows player
- [x] Add platform spacing and positioning logic

### Phase 2: Player Character (Doodle)
- [x] Create player data structure (position, velocity, etc.)
- [x] Implement player rendering as rectangle
- [x] Add gravity system
- [x] Implement jumping physics (fast start, slowing due to gravity)
- [x] Add collision detection with platforms
- [x] Implement automatic bouncing when landing on platforms
- [x] Horizontal movement with arrow keys (A/D also supported)
- [x] Screen wrapping (player wraps around horizontally)

### Phase 3: Score System
- [x] Platform counter that increments each time player lands on a new platform
- [x] Visual score display at top of screen using rectangle patterns
- [x] Prevent double-counting same platform

### Phase 4: Enhanced Physics and Controls
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Improved jump physics (faster initial speed, slower as it goes up)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Better gravity simulation with more realistic physics constants
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Enhanced horizontal movement with acceleration and friction
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Variable jump forces for different platform types
- [ ] BMI270 sensor integration for tilt controls (hardware integration phase)

## üîÑ In Progress Tasks

### Phase 5: Platform Types
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Normal platforms (green, static)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Moving platforms (orange, horizontal movement with edge bouncing)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Breakable platforms (brown, disappear after landing)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Spring platforms (deep pink, higher jump) ‚úÖ Just completed!

### Phase 6: Game Mechanics
- [ ] Implement game over conditions ‚úÖ Basic version done
- [ ] Add restart functionality ‚úÖ R key works
- [ ] Implement infinite map generation (procedural platforms) ‚úÖ Basic version done
- [ ] Difficulty scaling (wider gaps, fewer platforms as you go higher)

### Phase 7: Monster System (Later Implementation)
- [ ] Add monster data structures
- [ ] Implement monster movement 
- [ ] Implement different monster strengths at different scores. 
- [ ] Add collision detection between bullets and monsters
- [ ] Add monster destruction mechanics
- [ ] Implement shooting mechanism (Enter key to shoot upwards)
- [ ] Add visual feedback for shooting

### Phase 8: Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Particle effects for jumping
- [ ] Better visual representation (sprites instead of rectangles)
- [ ] Background parallax scrolling
- [ ] Platform destruction animations
- [ ] Player animation states (jumping, falling)

### Phase 9: Audio
- [ ] Jump sound
- [ ] Platform land sound
- [ ] Game over sound
- [ ] Background music

### Phase 10: Game States
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Pause functionality
- [ ] High score system
- [ ] Game over screen with restart option ‚úÖ Basic restart works

### Phase 11: Hardware Integration
- [ ] BMI270 accelerometer/gyroscope integration for tilt controls
- [ ] BME690 sensor integration (maybe for environmental effects?)
- [ ] Proper badge keyboard support
- [ ] Performance optimization for ESP32-P4

### Phase 12: Optimization and Polish
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Frame rate optimization
- [ ] Code cleanup and documentation
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Configuration system (difficulty levels, controls)

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced playable game with improved physics!**
- ‚úÖ Player can move left/right with smooth acceleration and friction
- ‚úÖ Camera follows player upward smoothly
- ‚úÖ Score counter shows platforms landed at top of screen
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Three platform types - Normal (green), Moving (orange), Breakable (brown)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Enhanced jump physics with better gravity simulation
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Variable jump forces based on platform type
- ‚úÖ Game over when player falls too far
- ‚úÖ Restart with 'R' key when game is over
- ‚ùå No monsters yet (planned for later phases)
- ‚ùå No BMI270 sensor integration yet

## Next Priority Tasks
1. **Improve jump physics** - Make jumping feel more natural with initial burst and gravity
2. **Add platform variety** - Moving and breakable platforms for more interesting gameplay
3. **BMI270 integration** - Add tilt controls for ESP32-P4 badge
4. **Monster system** - Add enemies and shooting mechanics
