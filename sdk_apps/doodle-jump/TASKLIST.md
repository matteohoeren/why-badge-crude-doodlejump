- [x] **COMPLETED** - Better gravity simulation with more realistic physics constants
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Enhanced horizontal movement with acceleration and friction
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Variable jump forces for different platform types
- [ ] BMI270 sensor integration for tilt controls (hardware integration phase)

## üîÑ In Progress Tasks

### Phase 5: Platform Types
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Normal platforms (green, static)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Moving platforms (orange, horizontal movement with edge bouncing)

- [x] **COMPLETED** - Add restart functionality ‚úÖ R key works with improved game over screen
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Implement infinite map generation (procedural platforms) ‚úÖ Already working
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Difficulty scaling (wider gaps, fewer platforms as you go higher) ‚úÖ Just implemented!

### Phase 6.5: Bug Fixes & Polish
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Fix moving platform speed (reduced from 20 to 10 speed units)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Fix game over condition (triggers when whole player exits screen)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Add platform cleanup (remove off-screen platforms for performance)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Tested compilation and execution process
- [ ] **NEXT** - Fix game over banner centering and make font much bigger
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Platform cleanup (platforms disappear when off-screen) ‚úÖ Just implemented!
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Improved moving platform physics (proper speed and bounds checking) ‚úÖ Just fixed!

### Phase 7: Monster System (Later Implementation)
- [ ] Add monster data structures
- [ ] Implement monster movement

- [ ] Add collision detection between bullets and monsters
- [ ] Add monster destruction mechanics
- [ ] Implement shooting mechanism (Enter key to shoot upwards)
- [ ] Add visual feedback for shooting

### Phase 8: Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Particle effects for jumping
- [ ] Better visual representation (sprites instead of rectangles)
- [ ] Background parallax scrolling
- [ ] Platform destruction animations
- [ ] Player animation states (jumping, falling)

### Phase 9: Audio
- [ ] Jump sound
- [ ] Platform land sound
- [ ] Game over sound
- [ ] Background music

### Phase 10: Game States
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Pause functionality
- [ ] High score system
- [ ] Game over screen with restart option ‚úÖ Basic restart works

### Phase 11: Hardware Integration
- [ ] BMI270 accelerometer/gyroscope integration for tilt controls
- [ ] BME690 sensor integration (maybe for environmental effects?)
- [ ] Proper badge keyboard support
- [ ] Performance optimization for ESP32-P4

### Phase 12: Optimization and Polish
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Frame rate optimization
- [ ] Code cleanup and documentation
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Configuration system (difficulty levels, controls)

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced playable game with improved physics!**
- ‚úÖ Player can move left/right with smooth acceleration and friction
- ‚úÖ Camera follows player upward smoothly
- ‚úÖ Score counter shows platforms landed at top of screen
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Four platform types - Normal (green), Moving (orange), Breakable (brown), Spring (deep pink)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Enhanced jump physics with better gravity simulation
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Variable jump forces based on platform type
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Difficulty scaling - platforms get further apart as you go higher
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Big centered "GAME OVER" banner with much larger text
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Improved moving platform physics (proper speed and edge bouncing)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Platform cleanup system (platforms disappear when off-screen)
- ‚úÖ Game over when player's whole body exits screen (more precise)
- ‚úÖ Restart with 'R' key when game is over
- ‚ùå No monsters yet (planned for later phases)

3. **BMI270 integration** - Add tilt controls for ESP32-P4 badge
4. **Monster system** - Add enemies and shooting mechanics

## Build Instructions
```bash
# Navigate to doodle-jump directory
cd sdk_apps/doodle-jump

# Compile (replace paths as needed)
gcc main.c -o doodle-jump \
  -I/Users/matteo/Downloads/vendored/SDL/include \
  -L/Users/matteo/Downloads/vendored/SDL/build \
